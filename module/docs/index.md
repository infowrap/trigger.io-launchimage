``launchimage``: Launch images
==============================

The ``forge.launchimage`` namespace allows you to customize the image to display while your app is loading.

By default, the launch image is hidden automatically when the window ``load`` event fires or after 5 seconds, whichever is sooner. This gives your JavaScript some time to
initialize itself, set up [native topbars](/modules/topbar/current/docs/index.html) and
[tabbars](/modules/tabbar/current/docs/index.html) for example. If you want full control over hiding the launch image yourself, set **Hide Manually** to `true` in the config.

##Config options

The majority of the configuration for the is paths to images at various resolutions. All launch images must be placed in your ``src`` directory. Paths to your launchimages should be specified relative to your `src` directory.

> ::Note:: Use PNG format for your launch images, as it is required on at least iOS and your app
may not be submittable to the App Store otherwise.

iPhone
:	Path to 320x480px image. Used as the launch image on non-retina iDevices (e.g. iPhone 3GS, 3rd generation iPod).

iPhone Retina
:	Path to a 640x960px image. Used as the launch image on retina iDevices (e.g. iPhone 4).

iPhone Retina 4
:	Path to a 640x1136px image. Used as the launch image on retina for iDevices with a 4 inch screen (e.g. iPhone 5, 5th generation iPod).

iPhone Retina 6
:	Path to a 750x1334px image. Used as the launch image on retina for iDevices with a 4.7 inch screen (e.g. iPhone 6).

iPhone Retina 6 Plus
:	Path to a 1242x2208px image. Used as the launch image on retina for iDevices with a 5.5 inch screen (e.g. iPhone 6 Plus).

iPad
:	Path to a 768x1004px image. Used as the launch image on retina for non-retina iPads when in portrait.

iPad Landscape
:	Path to a 1024x748px image. Used as the launch image on retina for non-retina iPads when in landscape.

iPad Retina
:	Path to a 1536x2008px image. Used as the launch image on retina for retina iPads when in portrait.

iPad Landscape Retina
:	Path to a 2048x1496px image. Used as the launch image on retina for retina iPads when in landscape.

> ::Note:: All 7 iOS images must be defined for any to be included in iOS builds.

Android, Android Landscape
:	Launchimages for Android devices.
	On Android the image will be displayed according to the **Background Size**
	configuration option. A **Background Size** value of ``"auto"`` will result
	in the image being displayed as centered while the first page is loading.
	As Android device sizes vary a pixel perfect loading image cannot be used.
	The image will be proportionally scaled down to fit the screen if necessary.
	A **Background Size** value of ``"cover"`` will result in the image
	being uniformly scaled by maintaining the image's aspect ratio so
	that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal
	to or larger than the screen. The image is then centered in the view.
	The solid color to use behind this launch image can be configured with
	the **Background Color** configuration option.

> ::Note:: Both Android images must be defined for Android builds.

Background Color
:	The color to be shown behind the image if it doesn't fit the screen exactly, to be specified using
	a six digit hex color code - e.g. ``"#303045"``.

Background Size
:	Options for scaling the launch image which mimics the behaviour similar to the background-size
	property in CSS3. Options are ``"auto"`` or ``"cover"``.

Hide Manually
:	Setting this to `true` will prevent the automatic hiding of the launch image done by default,
	the launchimage will be hidden when you call [forge.launchimage.hide](index.html#forgelaunchimagehidesuccess-error).

##API
